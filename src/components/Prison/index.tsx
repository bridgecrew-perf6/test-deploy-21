                When you leave prison you should get back all the belongings you came in with. if your

                a <a className="accordion-link animated-underline" href="#">Budgeting Loan</a> to help you buy some. If any of your belongings have gone missing,
                you can make a complaint and might be able to go to court for compensation. You may also get:

                            get when released, UK legislation does include a discharge grant of Â£46 to help cover your
                            living expense for your first week out of prison. However, you must apply for a
                            discharge grant at least four weeks before your exit. Also, most prisoners under 18 won't
                            get a discharge grant.

                leave prison and may even mean you lose your home.
